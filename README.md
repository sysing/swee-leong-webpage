# Swee Leong — Personal Website

This is a minimal static site ready for GitHub Pages. It does not copy any content from external sites. Customize `index.html` with your details.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple static server.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages (user/organization site)
This repo is already connected to `origin`:

1. Commit and push changes to `main`.
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch" and select `main` as the branch and `/ (root)` as the folder.
4. Save. Your site will be available at `https://sysing.github.io/swee-leong-webpage/` (or your configured custom domain later).

## Notes
- If you add images, place them under `assets/img/`.
- `.nojekyll` ensures GitHub Pages serves files without Jekyll processing.
